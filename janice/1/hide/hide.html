    <h1> You see many houses as you try and find a good one to hide in.
        <h2>You find a big blue house to hide in</h2>
        <h3>**Knock knock**... Nobody answers and you enter</h3>
        <p>Inside is really red; everything is carpet.</p>
        <p>You sense you need to hide in a hole fast</p>
        <p> Your heart beats faster. You spot a little crevice!</p>
        <h2>Tons of hideous monsters pass by and you hold your breath...</h2>
        <h3>Golems, vampires, ghosts, evil clowns, and possessed dolls march down the hall</h3>
