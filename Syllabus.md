# Overview

This class will look at methods of using fundamental graphic design principles and website development tools to create sites that are strategic, interactive, energetic and visually imaginative. This course will also explore the social, political, and historical contexts around network technologies and look at the rich history of programmers, designers, artists, and others that have used the web as a medium to develop new and alternative approaches to graphic design for the web.

# Projects

## Weekly prompts

Every week, you will receive a prompt to conceive, design, and program a website. Some of the prompts will focus on functionality or intended use; other prompts will give constraints to work within; some will do both. You will submit your work by adding a link to the class repository by 12 noon every Monday.

## Research

As the semester continues, you will choose a contemporary artist or designer working on the web to research. You will share your findings with the class in a 15 min presentation.

## Archive/show

At the end of the semester, we will work as a class to collaboratively document and present selected websites from over the course of the semester. The format of this archive is TBD based on class discussion.

# Grading

Grades from A to F will be assigned at the end of the semester. The grade will be calculated as follows:

|Item|Percentage|
|:---|:---|
|Participation|30%|
|Each weekly project|5%|
|Class documentation|20%|
|TOTAL|100%|

Grades will be evaluated based on: strength of concept and form, craft, degree of risk-taking and depth of investigation, and relevance to a wider design and social context.

# Policies

Be prepared and on time for every class. Three unexcused absences will result in failure of the course, and repeated late arrivals will affect your grade. Take part in critique and discussion and use class time well.
