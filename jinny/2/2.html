             <a class = "special3">A large-scale sculpture</a> by acclaimed <a class = "special4">British artist Cornelia Parker</a>, inspired by the <a class = "special">paintings of Edward Hopper</a> and by two emblems of American architecture—the <a class ="special5">classic red barn</a> and the Bates family's sinister mansion from <a class = "special2">Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho</a>—comprises the fourth annual installation of site-specific works commissioned for <a class = "special6">The Met's Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden</a>.

                Nearly 30 feet high, the sculpture is fabricated from a deconstructed red barn and seems at first to be a genuine house, but is in fact a <a class = "special8">scaled-down structure consisting of two facades propped up from behind with scaffolding</a>. Simultaneously authentic and <a class = "special7">illusory</a>, Transitional Object <a class="special11">(PsychoBarn)</a> evokes the psychological associations embedded in architectural spaces. It is set atop <a class="special12">The Met</a>, high above <a class = "special9">Central Park</a>—providing an unusual contrast to the <a class = "special10">Manhattan skyline</a>.</p>
