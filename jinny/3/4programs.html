        <h4>Highlights from the Collection: Design Into Art</h4>
        
        <h5>Wednesday, January 27, 2016 - Sunday, January 8, 2017</h5>
        
        <p>Long before it was widely accepted to do so, Noguchi ignored the traditional distinction between “art” and “design.” This exhibition focuses on the permeable membrane between these categories in Noguchi's work, with lightweight and flat-packable furniture, stage sets, sculpture, and Akari Light Sculptures.</p>
