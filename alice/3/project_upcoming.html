                    <p>An evening of performances around the Ant Farm/LST inflatable featuring Japanese singer, songwriter, and musician Miho Hatori (Cibo Matto, Gorillaz), the collaborative hyperscape sensory duo MSHR, and dense noise composer and projectionist Doron Sadja.</p>
                    <p>Miho Hatori is a Japanese singer, songwriter, and musician. She is primarily known as the vocalist of the New York City group Cibo Matto. She is also known for her work with virtual band Gorillaz.</p>
                    <p>MSHR is a collaborative project by Birch Cooper and Brenna Murphy. The duo builds and explores systems as a way of manifesting ecstatic sensory zones. They work at the intersection of digital sculpture, analog hardware and ceremonial performance. Their current performance series revolves around a unique system of light-audio feedback that employs their hand made synthesizers.</p>
                    <p>Doron Sadja is an American artist, composer, and curator whose work explores modes of perception and the experience of sound, light, and space. Working primarily with multichannel, spatialized sound and combining pristine electronics with lush romantic synthesizers, extreme frequencies, dense noise, and computer-enhanced acoustic instruments, Sadja creates post-human, hyper-emotive sonic architecture.</p>
