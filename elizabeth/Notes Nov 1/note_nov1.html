<h2>Thinking about web as a space</h2>

<p>Creating an identity that lives in a browser window
some issues around identity (and how it is shifting)<br>

Developing an identity system<p>


<!--still want to make moon typography ...time based-->

<h2>identities in motion<h2>

<p>google typeface (old) detailed and slow to load—and would fall back to default 
new logo, basic shapes represented mathematically

does this identity feel..
conventional graphic identity
what do we think about an identity system that presents a simple and friendly tone when the organization is in fact engaged in extremely complex activity

unrealistic to expect honesty? from a company's representation of itself
what is the function of an identity...anyway?

Google is playing to an idea of a friendly neighborhood 

Accuracy and honesty used to be a successful strategy—not the case now, at least for Google

powerful companies proposing themselves as fun, friendly,

<p>units. MCA. general principles moving to specific application. + color palette.

does MCA logo push back against the monolithic design of the Google or the Airbnb

Bruce Mau: NAi logo...variable in that it is always projected and then photographed...takes on context and surface</p>

<!--shapes three way: scaled, surface, shift-->
<p>Slought identity (philly) (thinking about work as in the cloud, in philadelphia, and in the world) colors shift back and forth depending on focus

Eyebeam...dynamic letters created from data...so not ever one Eyebeam lockup...but sources from constantly changing data
Sulki & Min: BMW Guggenheim Lab...words are filled in with content</p>

Linked by Air identity for GSAP book imprint...ratio is matched to dimension of the book, with weight signified by weight of stroke. Variable mark...system that repeats and identifies</p>

<p>right now, because of dynamic quality of the web...designers are trying to design systems that have a cloud of possibilities...instead of saying x, this is the logo, it defines the space of possibilities...</p>

<p>part of what is driving this, is that we are getting used to looking at things are different sizes. Fludity is an important aspect of our contemporary experience. </p>

<p> somehow refreshing to make a project that is not about a specific mark?</p>

<p>work that is done by the system, not the form </p>

design living on is waves of secondary impact because of meme culture (drake). the second life of the image outside the control of the creator (and when this is intended!!! calculated)

a more anarchic mode of identity creation

memes...meme generators...both part of and beyond original conversation and culture
type appliques
the idea of the online applique

how do you design somethign that is RESPONSIVE and can stretch and vary.
cannot count on vertical height
poster or book...what does this site resemble.

How to make responsive...scaling vs. sizing down
What size are we considering this at. 
Thinking about typesize...the further away, the more the type needs to be scaled
perceived proportions

typography...javascript libraries to clean this up?
adding special spans? kerning .js library that lets you kern the type

Design slightly robust designs that don't require a lot of fussing

Scale <i>is</i>part of type.
web functioning at all different scales
web functioning as a poster...large, impression...doing something different than having the type set smaller
web posters

control highlight funtion with css...can also just change the type color instead of highlighting

</div>

<!--brand swapping...-->

<!--using existing interfaces and navigating within—(google maps)this is a method that I used and how I see myself operating as a designer within current conditions..responding...intervening...also how conversation is???(((())))-->

Work with what you know to do something interesting
Use Javascript and Jquery...to be helpful, but it doesn't have to be super complicated or can just use CSS if we want. 
Keep it simple and interesting.

From Alice's—the highlighting of the divs, and (can the highlight change colors)

how do you specifcy how to stack vertically when you are resizing?

class names with a number don't work

ids always override classes, so make sure there isn't anything overriding.

SCALE when it comes to websites. considering relationships of elements, and relationship of user to screen.
using color...what's different between screen and a book
how a book reflects light
contrast much higher...colors are brighter...very pure light

color-additive---room
looking at colorspace—projecting this and letting the other projector make the color
scaled color mixing
additive and reductive (as methods of production)

what is available only on web to access..


<p>domain...ip address in terminal</p>

archiving findings...
