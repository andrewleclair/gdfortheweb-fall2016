5 am. 

<p>Your alarm wakes you. The room is dark, you feel rested. Your class is at 11. You have time for a full morning... gym, coffee, leisurely breakfast. Maybe do some reading, catch up on emails. Maybe even do a bit of writing. Why not?</p>

<p>The air is cool. The blankets are warm.</p>
<p></p>

<p>You could snooze for a few minutes, enjoying the drowsy ease of the early morning.</p>

<p><a href="snooze_til_five_thirty.html">Yes</a>?</p>

<p><a href="get_up.html">No</a>.</p>
