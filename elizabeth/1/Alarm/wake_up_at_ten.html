<p>10:00 am</p>

<p>Oh noo, you've definitely overslept.</p>

<p>So predictable. The snooze button is never a good idea!</p>

<p>You still have just time to get ready and get to class.</p>

<p>No problem.</p>

<p>Ok. <a href="get_up_at_ten.html">Up!</a></p>

<p>Or maybe <a href="one_more_minute.html">one more minute.</a>You're already going to be rushing and stressed. And you're soooo sleepy.</p>
