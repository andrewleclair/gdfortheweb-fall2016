8:30 am.

<p>Your alarm goes off. Whoa, it's later than you thought. How did this happen?</p>

<p> But there's still time to get ready.</p> 

<p> The sky is clear blue, and bright. The red brick of the building across. You've always loved this view.</p> 

<p>You're enjoying the colors from your cozy nest, and feeling indulgent even though it's not even that late.</p>

<p><a href="get_up_eight_thirty.html">You could get up now.</a></p>

<p>Or you could luxuriate a little longer.</p>

<p>You're awake already, just enjoying a slow start to things.</p> 

<p>You don't really even need an alarm.</p>

<p><a href="wake_up_at_ten.html">Just ten minutes more.</a></p>
