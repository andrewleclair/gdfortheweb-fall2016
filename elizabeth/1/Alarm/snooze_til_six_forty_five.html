6:45 am.

<p>It's feeling like it's probably a good time to get up. The light outside is stronger, the rest of the world is waking up.</p>

<p>There are some things that would be nice to do this morning, but you're a student. A little extra sleep can't be a bad thing. Just a few more minutes.</p>

<p>Snooze til 7:00?</p>

<p><a href="snooze_til_seven.html">Yes</a></p>
