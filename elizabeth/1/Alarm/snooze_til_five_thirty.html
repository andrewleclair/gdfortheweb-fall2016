5:30 am. 

<p>You open your eyes.</p>

<p>The room is still cool, the sky outside now shades of pink and blue.</p>

<p>If you get up now, you can take the dog to the park for an hour, then shower and clean up a bit before heading to the library for eight. That's three solid hours of work before the school day really even starts.</p>

<p>Get up?</p>

<p> <a href="get_up_at_five_thirty.html">Yes!</a></p>

<p> or </p>

<p><a href="snooze_til_six.html">Snooze til six or so.</a></p>
