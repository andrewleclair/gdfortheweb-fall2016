<p>At night in the summer, Joyce leaves the door open and sits on the steps.</p>

<p>She is the mysterious artist in residence.</p>

<p>Last summer, you and friend were passing by after a meal at Julian's.</p>

<p>A man was taking out the trash, rearranging the bins. Your friend asked if he would show you inside.</p>

<p>You were startled but the tour was amazing.</p>

<p>He was the carpenter, and has been working on the house for thirty years. He has a dog that follows him around; you've seen them before at the gas station.</p>

<p>They had just restored the frescoes upstairs.</p>

<p>Downstairs, the paneling of the double parlor is dark, dark maple and brilliant stained glass. The ceilings are endless; there are four floors.</p>

<p>The detailing was like nothing else you've ever seen.</p>

<p>Two cats occupy the circular room on the first floor. It is the most opulent litter box situation you have ever seen.</p>

<p>In the adjacent lot, they are growing sunflowers.</p>

<p>You pass two little boys on the corner, waiting for the early bus to pick them up. Their hair is parted perfectly.</p>

<p>At the corner, you cross over towards Seven Stars.</p>
