<p>The bagel store took forever to open.</p>

<p>Code issues.</p>

<p> There used to be a Chinese restaurant in the back of this same building, facing out onto the large parking lot parallel to Battey, but the ripple effect of the buildng violations put them out of business. A new restaurant has replaced them. </p>

<p> A few years ago, or maybe many, the building was the location of the Italian American club. The parking lot was operated by a little old man with white gloves, who chained the lot closed at 9pm, and reopened it at 7am each morning.</p>

<p>It was better then, says the neighbor across the street. She and her husband have lived in their blue house for twenty eight years. She thinks the neighborhood is getting worse.</p>

<p>You rather suspect that your presence on the street suggests the opposite.</p>

<p>Though this is not necessarily a good thing, and an awkward one——to consider oneself relationally to a place, a past, a present condition.</p>

<p>A passing thought. You <a href="you_continue_on.html">continue on.</a>
