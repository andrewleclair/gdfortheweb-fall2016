 <p>Five steps down, steep, always the fleeting dark thought of a casual trip, and its consequences. </p>

 <p>Beside the steps, the Concord grapes drape themselves on the black iron fence in tangled constellations of vine and leaf.</p>

<p>There are far fewer grapes this year, perhaps because of the frost, suddenly and surprisingly, in April. Or perhaps because of the man who stops by for the occasional handful with great regularity. </p>

<p>Two years ago, August, the first night in the new apartment; we picked bunches and bunches and boiled them down into a jelly, which we ate with Roman grandeur in a kitchen with one table and two chairs. </p>


<p>Across the street, the sun is hitting the corner of the <a href="big_house">big house, splitting into into panes of lit green and gold.</a></p>

The light changes and the walk signal chirps encouragingly. <a href="across_battey.html">You cross.</a>
