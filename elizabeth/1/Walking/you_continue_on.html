In between the theater and the gas station is the Viola.</p>

<p>Squat brick with tinted windows. It houses various and generic business.</p>

<p>A white hatchack parks in the drive-through teller window overnight. A former bank, now a parking haven.</p>

<p>An alleyway next to the fence cuts through to an <a href="enormous_house.html">enormous house,</a> red and white, nearly hidden by the subdivisions of decades ago.

Past the gas station, at Julian's, they are dragging out the mechanical horse for the day. The kids love it. <a href="julians.html">You wonder who is working today as you cross the half block to the corner.</a></p>
