# Website #7

Using the institution you chose for Website #3, develop an identity system that responds to the participatory and programmatic context of the internet.

Consider how to take advantage of different forms of meaningful input — from users, from APIs, etc — to generate variable forms.

Build a 1-page website with a functional version of your identity centered on the page.
