# Website #3

Make a website for an art museum or gallery in New York that changes over time.

Think about possible timeframes of change:

* 1 hour
* 1 day
* 1 month
* 1 year
* Some other schedule

And some existing means of displaying time:

* Clock
* Calendar
* etc

And some possible formal variables:

* Typography
* Color
* Form

Keep in mind that this institution likely already has a complex and comprehensive website. Donâ€™t aim to make a perfect or complete copy of it. Instead, make choices about what information to include (and what information to exclude) to make a viable and interesting alternative to the existing web presence.
